            <p>
                I'm Nobody! Who are you? <br/>

                Are you - Nobody - Too?<br/>

                Then there's a pair of us!<br/>

                Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!<br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br/>

                How public - like a Frog -<br/>

                To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog!<br/>
